# ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE

## Firebase Secrets Exposed

**CRITICAL:** The Firebase API keys in this repository were accidentally committed to GitHub and are publicly visible in the commit history.

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Regenerate Firebase API Keys** (URGENT):
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project: `tubesoundboard`
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ General
   - Delete the current Web App and create a new one
   - This will generate new API keys

2. **Update Environment File**:
   - Copy `.env.production.template` to `.env.production`
   - Fill in the NEW Firebase configuration values
   - Never commit `.env.production` to Git (it's now in .gitignore)

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - The `.env.production` file is now properly ignored by Git
   - Use the template file for new deployments
   - Consider rotating any other potentially exposed secrets

### Git Security

The repository's `.gitignore` has been updated to prevent future accidents:
```
# React environment files

tube-react-frontend/.env.development
tube-react-frontend/.env.production
tube-react-frontend/.env.test
```
